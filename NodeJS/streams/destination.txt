A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) in AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a customizable private network 
within the AWS cloud where you can launch and manage your AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, 
in a secure and isolated environment. It provides full control over your virtual networking setup, 
including IP address ranges, subnets, route tables, and gateways.
